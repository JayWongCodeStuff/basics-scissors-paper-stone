How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
After all the commits, about 5 hours.

Please fill in one error and/or error message you received while working on this assignment.
In trying to refactor my code, I did have a lot of syntax errors where I did not properly close the functions with an appropriate curly bracket. Other than that, for some reason, when the player input paper and the computer chose rock - the output would say that both had chosen paper and it was a draw. This logical error did not apply if the player input rock or scissors. I couldn't see what was the issue with my if (input == paper) block and it was a logical error so there was no error being picked up by either the browser or VSC. I just typed in some console logs and retyped a bit of the code and for some reason it worked out after that.

What part of the assignment did you spend the most time on?
It would be implementing the base functionality (my first commit). Looking back before making a few more commits to refactor my code, I think I was more focused on making the game work rather than thinking about how my code would look like as a finished product. It worked out in the end, but after my first commit I could tell that my code was for lack of a better word, 'ugly' and with a lot of redundancies that caused me to copy paste a lot of strings. I knew that I could organise my code better through refactoring, but I only managed to realise what I could cut after learning about global variables and doing exercises that prompted me to use them to store strings.

Comfort Level (1-5):
4
I wouldn't say programming the overall logic of this game was hard, but rather the practice of refactoring code and learning to make my code more efficient and readable would be the main challenge of this project (if that is applicable in terms of the question)

Completeness Level (1-5):
4
Still think I can refactor some things to make the code more efficient, but compared to the first commit - I am quite proud of my fifth.

What did you think of this deliverable?
I think this project is great as a starter one as it is very simple in terms of its logic, which allows us as students to focus more on the programming side of things which we probably need more practice with! Looking forward to bigger and more challenging projects.

Is there anything in this code that you feel pleased about?
My improvement in refactoring the code.
